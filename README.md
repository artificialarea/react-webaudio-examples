## A Starter Project for Building Projects with the Web Audio API

The genesis for the application is a tech talk given at the [ReactNYC Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ReactNYC/) on 10/11/2017.

The videos of the talk will be up shortly so you can discover the context of this project.

Feel free to clone and build on this project or contribute to the repo as you see fit! Share the amazingness of webaudio with the world!



--- FYI ---

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
